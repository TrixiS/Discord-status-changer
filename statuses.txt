🏳️‍🌈 Eye on the TV 15
🏳️‍🌈 'Cause tragedy thrills me 15
🏳️‍🌈 Whatever flavour 15
🏳️‍🌈 It happens to be like; 15
🏳️‍🌈 Killed by the husband 15
🏳️‍🌈 Drowned by the ocean 15
🏳️‍🌈 Shot by his own son 15
🏳️‍🌈 She used the poison in his tea 15
🏳️‍🌈 And kissed him goodbye 15
🏳️‍🌈 That's my kind of story 15
🏳️‍🌈 It's no fun 'til someone dies 15
🏳️‍🌈 Don't look at me like 15
🏳️‍🌈 I am a monster 15
🏳️‍🌈 Frown out your one face 15
🏳️‍🌈 But with the other 15
🏳️‍🌈 Stare like a junkie 15
🏳️‍🌈 Into the TV 15
🏳️‍🌈 Stare like a zombie 15
🏳️‍🌈 While the mother 15
🏳️‍🌈 Holds her child 15
🏳️‍🌈 Watches him die 15
🏳️‍🌈 Hands to the sky crying 15
🏳️‍🌈 Why, oh why? 15
🏳️‍🌈 'Cause I need to watch things die 15
🏳️‍🌈 From a distance 15
🏳️‍🌈 Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies 15
🏳️‍🌈 You all need it too, don't lie 15
🏳️‍🌈 Why can't we just admit it? 15
🏳️‍🌈 Why can't we just admit it? 15
🏳️‍🌈 We won't give pause until the blood is flowing 15
🏳️‍🌈 Neither the brave nor bold 15
🏳️‍🌈 The writers of stories sold 15
🏳️‍🌈 We won't give pause until… 15
