🏳️‍🌈 'Cause tragedy thrills me 10
🏳️‍🌈 Whatever flavour 10
🏳️‍🌈 It happens to be like; 10
🏳️‍🌈 Killed by the husband 10
🏳️‍🌈 Drowned by the ocean 10
🏳️‍🌈 Shot by his own son 10
🏳️‍🌈 She used the poison in his tea 10
🏳️‍🌈 And kissed him goodbye 10

🏳️‍🌈 It's no fun 'til someone dies 10
🏳️‍🌈 Don't look at me like 10
🏳️‍🌈 I am a monster 10
🏳️‍🌈 Frown out your one face 10
🏳️‍🌈 But with the other 10
🏳️‍🌈 Stare like a junkie 10
🏳️‍🌈 Into the TV 10
🏳️‍🌈 Stare like a zombie 10
🏳️‍🌈 While the mother 10
🏳️‍🌈 Holds her child 10
🏳️‍🌈 Watches him die 10
🏳️‍🌈 Hands to the sky crying 10
🏳️‍🌈 Why, oh why? 10
🏳️‍🌈 'Cause I need to watch things die 10
🏳️‍🌈 From a distance 10
🏳️‍🌈 Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies 10
🏳️‍🌈 You all need it too, don't lie 10
🏳️‍🌈 Why can't we just admit it? 10
🏳️‍🌈 Why can't we just admit it? 10
🏳️‍🌈 We won't give pause until the blood is flowing 10
🏳️‍🌈 Neither the brave nor bold 10
🏳️‍🌈 The writers of stories sold 10
🏳️‍🌈 We won't give pause until… 10
